# What is this?
I need to keep track oh-my-zsh custom directory (`$ZSH_CUSTOM`) when I have to work in multiple different environments. I am also exhausted by copying & pasting oh-my-zsh custom directory EVERY SINGLE TIME I install Oh My Zsh!.

Thus, that is why this repository present to the world.
